# Music Releases
This week we got to practice React and creating components by using data from Spotify. We built a page which shows new album and single releases. This project was done by group programming.

## The problem
Initaly we had some issues with mapping but we soon figured it out by reading the material that was provided. We also got help from our teammates.
If we had more time, we would try to complete the black requirements and also create more components. 

This week was good because we started off with a plan and we managed to stick to it.
